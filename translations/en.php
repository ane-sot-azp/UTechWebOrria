    "alb1Lab" => "The Basque Center for Artificial Intelligence (BAIC) has conducted its first analysis of this
                technology. According to the data provided, at least 89 companies are developing AI, and although they
                may not be enough to meet demand, 908 people have some training in this area.",
    "alb1Alb1" => "In the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (EAE), 12.2% of entities use Artificial Intelligence
                (AI) systems. Although the sector is still in its early stages, it shows significant growth. BAIC has
                published a diagnostic report for 2023, analyzing the state of the AI ecosystem. Founded in 2021, BAIC
                comprises 700 stakeholders, including public organizations, companies, and training centers.",
    "alb1Alb2" => "According to the report, the Basque Country is above the national average, with AI usage comparable to
                that of the United Kingdom, France, or Germany. Public administration shows a higher rate of use
                (16.4%), and among businesses, 89 companies offer AI solutions, generating a turnover of 105 million
                euros last year.",
    "alb1Alb3" => "Additionally, the availability of AI education is increasing, with around 900 people specializing
                annually, although this is still insufficient to meet demand. In the field of research, 1,200
                professionals are working, and there are 21 Data Processing Centers and 6 high-performance computing
                centers in the Basque Country.",

    "alb2Lab" => "We have met Tecnalia's newest robots at their research center located in the Gipuzkoa Science and 
                Technology Park. Urko Esnaola, director of robotics projects, said: 'Even the most advanced imaginations 
                do not know how far robotics can go.'",
    "alb2Alb1" => "According to projections from The Business Research Company, the international robotics industry will
                generate 120 billion euros this year, and by 2028, business volume is expected to double. In the
                European Union alone, the sector is expected to grow by 68% this year, and Tecnalia is one of the
                references in robotic research in the Basque Country. We were welcomed by Urko Esnaola, director of
                robotics projects at Tecnalia, at the research center’s headquarters in the Gipuzkoa Science and
                Technology Park.",
    "alb2Alb2" => "Esnaola introduced us to three robots: Thomas, developed in collaboration with the company Robotnik,
                which polishes parts for the aerospace industry; a robotic arm capable of automating polishing using
                virtual reality glasses; and NextStage, a humanoid capable of autonomously assembling glass-ceramic
                pieces using voice commands (including in Basque).",
    "alb2Alb3" => "We’ve made great strides in recent years,' Esnaola explained, 'and we’re in a very good position in the
                international competition.' He emphasized that the future challenge is 'ease of use,' so that 'anyone'
                can program the robot: 'We need to work on intelligence, vision, and artificial intelligence to
                facilitate communication between humans and robots.' Esnaola described a future 'full of possibilities'
                for Tecnalia’s robotics projects: 'Even the most advanced imaginations don’t know how far robotics could
                reach.",

                second life and reduce the environmental impact of electronic devices.",
    "historia2" => "The two friends observed that millions of phones were discarded each year, even though many could be
                repaired and reused. With this idea in mind, they created IA Market, a company that buys, repairs, and
                sells second-hand or refurbished mobile phones at affordable prices.",
    "historia3" => "Beñat, an expert in hardware, used his curiosity about hardware and software to quickly diagnose issues
                with devices and optimize repairs. Ane, experienced in sustainability, took charge of creating a
                business model based on the principles of a circular economy.",
    "historia4" => "Today, UTech not only offers mobile phones at lower prices but also helps reduce electronic waste
                and promotes more responsible consumption. Each phone sold is a step towards a more sustainable
                future.",

    "helburuak1" => "At UTech, our mission is clear: to reduce the environmental impact of technology by giving used
                mobile phones a new life. We buy, repair, and sell refurbished devices to promote more responsible and
                accessible consumption.",
    "helburuak2" => "We believe in a circular economy, where products can be reused instead of ending up as electronic waste.
                Additionally, we work to make technology more accessible to everyone by offering high-quality mobile
                phones at fair prices, all while contributing to a more sustainable future.",
